# Tutorial: candidate_interface

The `candidate_interface` project provides an **automated testing framework** for interacting with online technical assessments. It allows testers to simulate candidate actions like answering questions, submitting code, and navigating through tests. The framework is built around a hierarchical structure where `QuestionsBase` provides common functionality that specialized question handlers inherit, while the `CandidateAssessmentPage` orchestrates the overall test flow from login to submission. This design enables *consistent interaction* with diverse question types (MCQ, programming, SQL, etc.) through a unified interface.
